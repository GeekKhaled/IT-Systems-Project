This is a project myself and colleagues did in IT Systems Course (IT281)
Where we did extensive research on Amazon's Marketplace Web Service (MWS) API
How it worked, what problem it is solving, it's capabilities ,benefits and objectives etc...
With use cases, functional and non-funciontal requirements and a lot of diagrams explaining how it all worked.
